# EDA on Global Terrorism dataset
I have done an exploratory data analysis on Global Terrorism dataset using Tableau. To serve this purpose,I have performed initial data cleaning on given dataset (removed unwanted columns with huge missing values); exported cleaned data into Tableau and prepared multiple visualization based on diffrent aspect of Terrorism.

Graphical Explanation:
1) Filled country map is to visualize a rate of terrorism in diffrent countries. Iraq has been the most affected country by terror attack for a period of 1970 to 2017.
2) Pie chart is referring percentage break-up of 'Type of weapons' used to spread terrorism.
3) Area chart is potraying Country wise terror attak frequency for given time period(1970-2017).
4) Bar chart is to get a breakup of highest terror attack target areas.
5) Lastly, packed bubble chart is to visualize yearwise Top 10 affected country by terrorism.

Pie chart, Area chart and bar chart can be varied by using 'Country txt' dropdown wheras bubble chart can be changed through 'year' variation.
